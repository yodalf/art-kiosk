# Notes for Claude Code

## Git & GitHub Workflow

**IMPORTANT**: Never push to GitHub without explicit permission from the user.

- Always commit changes locally when making updates
- Wait for explicit "push" or "push to github" instruction before running `git push`
- This applies to all future sessions and conversations
